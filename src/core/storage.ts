/**
 * What the player remembers between visits, and where.
 *
 * Two different things with two different lifetimes:
 *
 * - **Preferences** (volume, muted, speed) belong to the reader and are the same
 *   on every recording. Setting the volume once per video is the kind of small
 *   tax that makes a site feel unfinished.
 * - **Positions** belong to one recording each. An hour-long live that somebody
 *   watches over two evenings is the normal case, not the exotic one.
 *
 * Both live in localStorage, which means both are per-browser and can vanish:
 * a private window, cleared site data, a different device. Every read is
 * therefore allowed to return nothing and every write is allowed to fail — in
 * some contexts merely *touching* localStorage throws, so the accessor itself
 * is wrapped, not just the parse.
 *
 * Positions are one key holding a map rather than a key per recording. A key
 * per recording grows without bound in the browsers of the people who use the
 * site most, and there is no natural moment to sweep it.
